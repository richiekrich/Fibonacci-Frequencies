# Fibonacci Frequencies
This Python script creates a sequence of Fibonnaci number and maps them to a set frequencies that can be heard by the human ear, and plays them in order from lowest to highest.
Before running the script, set the parameters for BPM and Volume to be played. The BPM (Beats-Per-Minute) slider adjusts the rate at which the frequencies are played.
Ensure that the audio is at a safe playback level, as some of the frequencies are harsh. 
You also have the option to lower the high-end frequencies using an adjustable equalizer slider to filter off the high-end frequencies before running the script. 
To start playing the audio, press the start button. 
To stop playing the audio, press the stop button.
